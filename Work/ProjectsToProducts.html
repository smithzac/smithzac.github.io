            <li>Continuously update this and share progress with the whole tech department</li>
            <li>Otherwise people will continue to go off on their own doing unaligned shit</li>
            <li>This is Technology, our Primary Operating Model, our strategy. This serves as an accessible reference to anyone in the business who needs it.</li>

            <li>Companies will usually have existing roles and responsibilities</li>

            <li>Most commonly this is done via 'Products', but could also be product groups, tech stacks or disciplines, or company objectives</li>
            <li>Requires tech and products collaboration. What makes sense, given underlying infrastructure, codebase, repos, but will also be clear to stakeholders within the business?</li>
            <li>A mixture of 'stream-aligned' and 'platform' teams may be required.</li>
            <li>This step is crucial to removing the incredibly inefficient, bottlenecked, and non-scalable top down management of all work by senior managers</li>
            <li>This is also a crucial setup step for connecting people in the business directly with people in tech</li>
